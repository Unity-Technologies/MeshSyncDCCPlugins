- While "Auto Sync" is checked, any changes to the Mesh will automatically be reflected in Unity. If Auto Sync is disabled, the "Manual Sync" button can be used to manually reflect changes
- Clicking Sync under Animations causes the timer to advance from the first frame to the final frame while baking the animation before sending it to Unity.

- The Polygon mesh's skinning/bone and BlendShapes will be carried over to Unity unchanged.
