#### Caveat

When installing a newer version of the plugin, the existing version must be removed first if it exists.  
Steps to remove:
1. Close all UnityMeshSync views.
1. Restart Modo.

If installing a newer version still fails even after doing the above steps, 
then please try to remove manually after closing Modo.
1. Windows:
   - Open settings file using a text editor.  
     Example: `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Roaming\Luxology\MODO<modo_version>.CFG`
   - Remove UnityMeshSync items like the following:
     ```
     <hash type="Server" key="12345678-abcd-1234-abcd-111122223333:UnityMeshSync">
       <atom type="Module">C:\ModoPlugins\Modo14\MeshSyncClientModo.lx</atom>
       <atom type="Direct">1</atom>
     </hash>
     ```
   - Save the settings file, and restart Modo.
